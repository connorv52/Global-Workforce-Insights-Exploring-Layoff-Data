# SQL_World_Layoffs_Data_Analysis 
This project utilizes SQL and pgAdmin 4 to rigorously clean and analyze layoff data from companies worldwide. 

Data cleaning will constitute the following:
- Remove Duplicates
- Standardize the Data
- Null Values (blank values)
- Remove Any Columns

To mitigate potential errors (and for peace of mind), we will create a direct copy of the layoffs table to work on. 

We follow our data cleaning with some exploratory data analysis. We will attempt to answer questions such as:
- Which industries have the largest number of layoffs in the dataset? Does this depend on the year?
- Do countries differ as much as industries do with their layoffs?
- Does the size or stage of the company matter regarding how many or what percentage of workers they lay off?
- Is it possible with SQL to see how many world layoffs accumulated by month over the several years of the dataset?
